I've been itching to run a science-fantasy (or even science-fiction)
game for a few years now ever since grabbing my copy of
[<i>Stars Without Number</i>][SWN].
To date none of my attempts at creating a sector of space dedicated
to playing in survived, especially when moving.
So this time I pulled up the [<i>Gygax 75 Challenge</i>][G75],
started writing this post for **permanence**, and got cracking.

# The What Challenge?

Long story short, the Gygax 75 Challenge summarizes a five-step
regimen to whip up enough of a setting for players to begin a
roleplaying game campaign based on
[a series Gary Gygax, the creator, wrote half a century ago][original].
Emphasis on the "enough" part, as the whole purpose is to get
the ball rolling for players to fill the blanks in.

# Pacts of the Onycx

## The Pitch

It all started with
[a post](https://bsky.app/profile/rocx.rocks/post/3klrvb64f5j2q)
in a vain attempt to be funny.

Skipping over how cool but impractical a gunblade may _actually_
be, I was onto something.
Granted it would take reflavoring the magic/psionic class to
something closer to the traditional cleric but it adds a lot
of potential flavor to a post-post-apocalyptic sector.

Guess the details will come later through further fleshing
out and through play.
This week's only about vague points anyway so without further ado...

### Vying Gods

The collapse of the Directorate was a major blow to humanity
throughout charted space.
Not only did it ruin any interstellar bonds and trade but it
also effectively wiped out the Psions that eventually turned
against the populace they helped.

Over time, all manners of eldritch beings popped up in their place,
granting the bold and the foolish special powers in exchange
for deeds or worship.
These are the titular pacts and they play an important role.

What are these gods' end goals and what schemes are they planning
with sophont pawns?

### Fantastical Worlds

Explore the Onycx sector!
Dive into the corrosive Altiyrian cloud sea for salvage in a subatmo.
Sneak to the water world of the Avowed Institutes to seek out a pact.
Feel the pressure of how Sasu Macasans came to be.
And more! Probably.

### The Mystery of Krei Vatha

Krei Vatha somehow became a myth passed down through the ages as the
last bastion of the old ways where the Last Director-General oversaw
reconstruction after the Psionic Revolt.
No one really believes that since there's no viable rutter to get there with.
Despite that, ships belonging to the autonomous corporations destined
to Krei Vatha appears other ports' ledgers.
The whole sector is perplexed and gets excited whenever that happens.

But first, they must figure out which ships those are.

### Rampant Anarchy

It takes at least a week to receive news of the neighboring world
breaking out into civil war or to hear about what a marquis there had
for brunch and that's just within _immediate_ jump distance.

Each world _mostly_ keeps their politics to themselves and any
coalitions are merely passive.
Not that relativity or metaspace hasn't stopped people from _trying_...


# Inspiration

* <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>.
  Underrated game.
  Inspired the "pacts" and science-fantasy part of this setting.
  There are many things to yank from it.
* [<i>Pale Lights</i>](https://palelights.com/)
  by "erraticerrata" (who is also known for <i>A Practical Guide to
  Evil</i>) better describes the relationship between pacters and the gods.
* Ã†sthetics of the 1980s to 2000s.
  Not the neon grid and driving-into-the-sunset '80s but
  a slightly more genuine take on it.
  Slightly.
  Where [your gear looks old but powers your spaceship][1]
  and the lost ancient style [comes from a bygone era][2].
* The [SCP Foundation][4].
  Great source of inspiration for magical items and monsters for
  most genres.
  Don't forget the stories!
  The sector's equivalent, the Artifact Seizure Service, was founded
  because it made a funny acronym.
  * [Project Heimdall][5] is especially of interest.
* Assorted analog horror like the [Gemini Home Entertainment][6]
  and [LOCAL58][7] YouTube channels for cosmic dread and the
  [Observable Radio][8] podcast.

I really wish I was more cultured to have better inspiration besides
a few titles and making the rest up later.

Next week will introduce us to a map of "the surrounding area" around
a town and a "dungeon" (pirate lair or something).

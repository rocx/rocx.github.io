  Surprise! It's a `rocx`-in-the-bocx!

It's like I can't get out of bed before tech-priests online yell
"You should fix your blog **NOW!** üå©Ô∏è‚ö°üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª‚ö°üå©Ô∏è" in my ear.
Guess it's that time of year again for a make-over.
Either that or another manic episode.
Should probably check on that.

No need for introductions.
There's one [somewhere around here](/about.html).

Everything else
[from 2020s](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104140046/https://rocx.rocks/)
or [that one time I discovered common knowledge](https://archive.is/j4nhn)
is still out there so no need to fret about "losing" anything.
Not like that rambling was of any value...

# Site Goals

* Apply good practices.
  Might have made it _too_ modular though with separate files for color
  palettes, font families, and includes/components to name a few.
 * Exercise discretion and be deliberate in what I say.
  Being spontaneous and not refining words is an issue to work on.
* Draw some more.
* Write more and use this site as an
  [authoritative source](https://xkcd.com/285/) when responding or
  commenting on other works.
* Setting up a digital garden?

# "It Looks Broken"

All the cool kids are [mixing paints][1] and [nesting their styles][2] now!
I'm declaring independence from Sass and will be living in the future!
